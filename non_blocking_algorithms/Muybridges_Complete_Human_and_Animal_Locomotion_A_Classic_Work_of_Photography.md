# Muybridge's Complete Human and Animal Locomotion: A Classic Work of Photography
 
Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) was a pioneering photographer who captured the motion of animals and humans in a series of remarkable images. His work, published in 1887 as *Animal Locomotion*, consisted of 781 plates showing various forms of movement in sequential frames. The plates were reproduced from his original photographs using a technique called collotype, which preserved the details and tones of the original negatives.

Muybridge's work was not only a scientific achievement, but also an artistic one. He carefully arranged his subjects in different poses and settings, creating dynamic compositions that revealed the beauty and grace of natural movement. His work influenced many artists and filmmakers, such as Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Alfred Hitchcock.
 
Muybridge's *Complete Human and Animal Locomotion* is a three-volume collection that contains all 781 plates from *Animal Locomotion*, as well as a prospectus and a catalogue of plates. It was published by Dover Publications in 1979, and is an unabridged republication of the original edition. The plates are arranged by subject matter, such as men, women, children, horses, dogs, cats, birds, elephants, and more. Each plate is accompanied by a descriptive caption that indicates the number of frames, the time interval between each frame, and the speed of the subject.
 
Muybridge's *Complete Human and Animal Locomotion* is a valuable resource for anyone interested in photography, art, science, history, or animation. It is a testament to Muybridge's vision and skill, and a fascinating glimpse into the world of motion.[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]
  
One of the most remarkable aspects of Muybridge's work is the variety and diversity of his subjects. He photographed not only animals and humans in motion, but also objects, such as water, smoke, and projectiles. He also experimented with different perspectives, such as aerial views, side views, and frontal views. He even used multiple cameras to capture different angles of the same movement.
 
Muybridge's work was also groundbreaking in terms of its scientific and technological implications. He used a system of electric shutters that were triggered by wires attached to the subjects or the ground. This allowed him to capture images at very high speeds, up to 1/2000th of a second. He also devised a device called the zoopraxiscope, which projected his images on a screen in rapid succession, creating the illusion of motion. This was one of the earliest forms of motion pictures.
 
Muybridge's *Complete Human and Animal Locomotion* is a treasure trove of information and inspiration for anyone who wants to learn more about the history and evolution of photography and cinema. It is also a stunning visual document that showcases the beauty and complexity of life in motion.
  
Muybridge's work was not without controversy and criticism. Some of his images were considered indecent or immoral, especially those depicting nude or semi-nude humans. Some of his subjects were also accused of being unnatural or exaggerated, such as a woman jumping over a stool or a man lifting a heavy weight. Some of his critics argued that his work was too mechanical and lacked artistic merit.
 
However, Muybridge's work also received praise and admiration from many quarters. He was supported and funded by prominent figures such as Leland Stanford, the former governor of California and the founder of Stanford University. He was invited to lecture and exhibit his work in various countries, such as England, France, Germany, and Russia. He was honored with medals and awards from various institutions, such as the Royal Society of Arts and the Photographic Society of London.
 
Muybridge's work has also inspired and influenced many artists and filmmakers over the years. Some of his images have been reproduced or referenced in paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints by artists such as Edgar Degas, Thomas Eakins, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Robert Rauschenberg. Some of his techniques and methods have been adopted or adapted by filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg.
